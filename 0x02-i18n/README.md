# 0x02-i18n

## Learning Objectives

- Understand how to parametrize Flask templates to display content in different languages.
- Learn how to infer the correct locale based on URL parameters, user settings, or request headers.
- Gain knowledge on how to localize timestamps to suit different regions or languages.

## Introduction

In this project, we delve into internationalization (i18n) and localization (l10n) techniques within Flask applications. By leveraging Flask's capabilities, we explore how to create multi-language web applications that cater to diverse user bases.

## Contents

1. **Setting Up Internationalization**: Learn the fundamentals of configuring Flask applications for internationalization, enabling the display of content in multiple languages.
   
2. **Parametrizing Flask Templates**: Understand how to structure Flask templates to accommodate language-specific content through parametrization.

3. **Inferring Locale**: Explore methods to automatically infer the user's preferred locale based on URL parameters, user settings, or request headers.

4. **Localizing Timestamps**: Discover techniques to localize timestamps within Flask applications to provide a seamless experience for users across different regions.
